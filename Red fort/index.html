   <h2><ins>About:</ins></h2>
   <p>Red Fort is one of the most visited places or destination in the capital city of India ie New Delhi. 
    It is a significant tourist destination in the country because it shows the power of Mughal history which ruled over different time limits. 
     Built by the Mughals at the zenith of their power, it has been visited by the Sikhs, Marathas, 
    the Afghans and the Persians—who took away the prized peacock throne and its crown jewel—the Kohinoor. 
    With the fall of the last Mughal, the British turned the fort and its pleasure palaces into military barracks.
    <br>
    Every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the prime minister hoists the Indian tricolour
     flag at the fort's main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from
     its ramparts through the Public Address System of Indian Army Corps of Signals. </p>
